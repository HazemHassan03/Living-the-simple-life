# Living-the-simple-life
A responsive landing page contains 3 pages ( Home - About me - Recent posts ) I developed using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. 

With HTML and CSS I created the whole layout of the page and made it responsive 100% using Flex Box and Media Queries.

Also, I created the main content of the page using the Mobile First rule.

In addition, I changed the styles of the scroll bar to be suitable for the styles of the page.

With JavaScript, I created the button that takes you to the top of the page and made the year "Copyright 2024" at the bottom of every page updated to the current year.
